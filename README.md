# Solidity Escrow Contract With Timelock 

An escrow Smart Contract which helps users facilitate transactions. 
User A should be able to deposit funds in the Smart Contract while user B should be able to withdraw the previously deposited funds from user A.

A timelock-like feature where funds will be automatically sent back to the depositor after a certain number of blocks has been mined and the funds haven't been withdrawn by user B.
